                <li>The Watermelon Tribe is a sovereignty of waterbenders and nonbenders.</li>
                <li>There are three tribes: the Northern Water Tribe, centered in the North Pole; the Southern Water Tribe, centered in the South Pole; and the Foggy Swamp Tribe, located in the Earth Kingdom's Foggy Swamp.</li>
                <li>Though the Northern chief was technically the ruler of both tribes, the South maintained control of its own internal affairs before ultimately gaining formal independence in 171 AG.</li>
                <li>Both the Northern and Southern Water Tribes are chiefdoms led by a tribal chief.</li>
                <li>On the other hand, the Foggy Swamp Tribe seemingly lacks formal political structure, with members in several small settlements functioning without a formal chief.</li>

                <li>The Airmelon Nomads, sometimes referred to as the Airmelon Nation in Firemelon Nation propaganda, were the collective of the airbender people.</li>
                <li>Though the people of this nation were nomadic, the Airmelon Nomads raised children and situated their central governments in four monastic temples located at various ends of the globe, two for males and two for females.</li>
                <li>The four air temples are located on small archipelagos that were Airmelon Nomad land on the tip of mountains and, in one case, hanging under cliffs.</li>

                <li>The Earthmelon Kingdom is the largest and most diverse of the four nations, comprised of a massive continent in the eastern hemisphere and several islands.</li>
                <li>The nation's people are strong and proud, with some of them being earthbenders.</li>
                <li>The Earthmelon Kingdom is extremely diverse, having mountainous, forested, grassland, desert, and man-conquered areas, including the vast megacity of Ba Sing Se.</li>
                <li>Due to its peoples' bending ability, the people of the Earthmelon Kingdom have created magnificent structures out of stone, such as the city Omashu.</li>
